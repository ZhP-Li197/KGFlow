## 1. 🤖 Overview

**DataFlow-KG** (short for DataFlow Knowledge Graph) is an LLM-driven knowledge graph processing library built on top of the [DataFlow](https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow) ecosystem. It is designed to provide reusable, extensible, and modular operators for knowledge graph construction, reasoning, retrieval, querying, and domain-specific applications. The original [DataFlow](https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow) project provides a clean, elegant, and highly extensible foundation for building practical data-centric LLM workflows.

Rather than treating KG workflows as isolated scripts, DataFlow-KG organizes graph capabilities into operator packages by graph type and application scenario. These operators can be composed into larger pipelines, including but not limited to:

- knowledge graph construction
- graph reasoning
- graph retrieval
- domain-specific knowledge graph applications

DataFlow-KG aims to serve as a unified infrastructure layer for research and development on graph-centric LLM applications.


## 2. ✨ Key Features

### 2.1. Modular Operator Library for KG Workflows
DataFlow-KG provides reusable operators that can be flexibly composed into pipelines for graph construction, graph enrichment, reasoning, retrieval, and task-specific graph processing. Operators are not standalone utilities. They are designed to be assembled into end-to-end workflows, enabling scalable and reproducible graph data engineering.

### 2.2 Unified Support for Multiple KG Paradigms
The library supports a broad range of graph settings in one framework, including general KG, commonsense KG, temporal KG, multimodal KG, hyper-relational KG, Graph RAG, and domain-specific KGs. As an extension of DataFlow, DataFlow-KG follows the same design philosophy of composable operators and pipeline-based processing, making it easy to integrate with broader data preparation workflows.

### 2.3. Research-to-Application Coverage
The framework is designed for both research scenarios and practical vertical applications, supporting graph processing tasks from foundational KG construction to specialized domain deployment.


## 3. 🔍 Installation

### 3.1. Create and activate a Python environment

```bash
conda create -n text2kg python=3.10
conda activate text2kg
````

### 3.2. Install DataFlow-KG

```bash
pip install uv
uv pip install dataflow-kg
```

If you want to enable **local GPU inference**, use:

```bash
conda create -n text2kg python=3.10
conda activate text2kg

pip install uv
uv pip install dataflow-kg[vllm]
```

> DataFlow-KG supports Python >= 3.10.

### 3.3. Verify the installation

You can check whether the installation is successful with:

```bash
text2kg -v
```

If the installation is correct and DataFlow-KG is the latest release, you will see something like:

```log
open-dataflow-kg codebase version: 0.9.0
        Checking for updates...
        Local version:  0.9.0
        PyPI newest version:  0.9.0
        You are using the latest version: 0.9.0.
```

In addition, the `text2kg env` command can be used to inspect the current hardware and software environment, which is useful for bug reporting:

```bash
text2kg env
```


## 4. 🚀 Quickstart

DataFlow-KG follows a **code generation + custom modification + script execution** workflow.  In practice, you initialize a project with the CLI, customize the generated pipeline script if needed, and then run the Python file to execute your workflow.

You can get started in **three steps**.

### 4.1. Initialize a project

Run the following command in an empty directory:

```bash
text2kg init
````

### 4.2. Choose a pipeline type

Pipelines with the same name across different folders are usually incremental variants with different dependency requirements:

| Directory       | Required Resources    |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| `api_pipelines` | CPU + LLM API         |
| `gpu_pipelines` | CPU + API + local GPU |

> **Tip:** If you are new to DataFlow-KG, start with `api_pipelines`.
> Later, if you have a local GPU, you can replace `LLMServing` with a local model backend.


### 4.3. Run your first pipeline

Go into any pipeline directory, for example:

```bash
cd api_pipelines
```

Open one of the generated Python pipeline files. In most cases, you only need to check two configurations:

#### 4.3.1 Input data path

```python
self.storage = FileStorage(
    first_entry_file_name="<path_to_dataset>"
)
```

By default, this points to the provided example dataset, so you can run it directly.
You can also replace it with your own dataset path.

#### 4.3.2 LLM serving configuration

If you are using an API-based serving backend, set the API key first.

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
export DF_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx
```

**Windows CMD**

```bat
set DF_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx
```

**PowerShell**

```powershell
$env:DF_API_KEY="sk-xxxxx"
```

Then run the pipeline script:

```bash
python xxx_pipeline.py
```
